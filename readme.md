## Blender

### Export

- Mute the palette texture node (loaded and set in Three.js `Material` directly)
- Use corresponding export presets
- Don't use compression (will be done later)

### Compress

Run `npm run compress`

Will do the following

#### GLB

- Traverses the `static/` folder looking for glb files (ignoring already compressed files)
- Compresses embeded texture with `etc1s --quality 255` (lossy, GPU friendly)
- Generates new files to preserve originals

#### Texture files

- Traverses the `static/` folder looking for `png|jpg` files (ignoring non-model related folders)
- Compresses with default preset to `--encode etc1s --qlevel 255` (lossy, GPU friendly) or specific preset according to path
- Generates new files to preserve originals

#### UI files

- Traverses the `static/ui.` folder looking for `png|jpg` files
- Compresses to WebP
